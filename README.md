This website I have coded completely by using HTML and CSS. 
I do also have a GitHub Repository that has all the work I did for the Bootcamp I took at University of Richmond. 
I have opened it to the public for you to take a look around to see what I have learned. 
When you look first open the website you will see # folders. 
Each one of these folders are labled with the what the topic was for this assignment. 
I included the intructions for the assignment and the included data for the assignent. 
I have put my answers in a folder that is labled "My Answer".
