       <p>Along with this website, which I have coded completely by using HTML and CSS, I do have a GitHub Repository that has all the work I did for the continued education course I took at University of Richmond. I have opened it to the public for you to take a look around to see what I have learned. When you look first open the website you will see folders. Each one of these folders are labled with what the topic was for this assignment. I included the intructions and the included data for the assignent. I have put my answers in a folder that is labled "My Answer". </p>
