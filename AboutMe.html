            <p>I am in search of a position in the area of data analytics and I am hoping you can look at my resume.</p>

                taught me a lot of my coding skills which include: the following Data 
                Analytics and Visualization: Advanced Excel; Pivot tables and VBA 
                Scripting: Fundamental Statistics; Modeling and Forecasting: Python

            <p>Currently, I live in Chesterfield, Virginia, but I am willing to relocate. 
                The organization, self-motivation, and the ability to adapt quickly to my 
                environment are part of my core abilities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My previous work experience includes working at the WestRock Corporation

                accounting and preoperative surgical services departments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My long-term goal is to find a data analytics position where I can use 
                the skills I have learned. I am interested in any open positions where
