            <h2>About me</h2>
            <hr width="100%" size="4" noshade="noshade" color="black">
            <p>I am in search of a position in the area of data analytics and I am hoping you 
                can look at my resume.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I graduated from Liberty University with a 3.0 GPA while obtaining a Bachelor 
                of Science in Healthcare Informatics focused on data analytics. I have also 
                completed a 24-week data analytics course at the University of Richmond to 
                expand my coding skillset. This course taught me a lot of coding skills 
                which include: Data Analytics and Visualization: Advanced Excel; Pivot 
                tables and VBA Scripting: Fundamental Statistics; Modeling and Forecasting: 
                Python Programming; Python 3, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, API, Interactions, 
                R, and Social Media Mining: Databases; MySQL and MongoDB: Front-End Web; 
                Visualization, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Dashboarding, JavaScript Charting. 
                DS.js, Geomapping with Leaflet.js; Business Intelligence Software; Tableau: 
                Advanced Topics; Big Data Analytics with Hadoop and Machine Learning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Currently, I live in Chesterfield, Virginia, but I am willing to relocate. 
                Organization, self-motivation, and the ability to adapt quickly to my 
                environment are part of my core abilities.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My previous work experience includes working at the WestRock Corporation 
                in the engineering department, managing AutoDesk, AutoCAD, and AutoDesk 
                Vault. I also worked at VCU Health Systems for two summers in the patient 
                accounting and preoperative surgical services departments.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My last job was at Octapharma Plasma as the Donor Screening Supervisor. 
                I did the tasks of a regular screener while maintaining compliance with 
                SOP, current Good Manufacturing Procedures (cGMP), and regulatory 
                guidelines and reported quality issues and procedural deviations to 
                Quality Assurance and Management. In addition, I was cross-trained to 
                be a DFT (Donor Floor Technician) to set up plasma donation machines 
                and take donors off the plasma donation machines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My long-term goal is to find a data analytics position where I can 
                use the skills I have learned. I am interested in any open positions 
                where I could use my work and educational experience.</p>

            <br>
            <br>

            <p style="text-align: center">Thank you for your consideration.</p>
