        <p>I am in search of a position in the area of data analytics and I am hoping you can look at my resume.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I will be graduating from Liberty University obtaining a degree in Healthcare Informatics with a focus on data analytics. I have also taken a 24-week data analytics course at the University of Richmond to expand on my coding skill set. This course taught me a lot of my coding skills which include: the following Data Analytics and Visualization: Advanced Excel; Pivot tables and VBA Scripting: Fundamental Statistics; Modeling and Forecasting: Python Programming; Python 3, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, API, Interactions, R, and Social Media Mining: Databases; MySQL and MongoDB: Front-End Web; Visualization, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Dashboarding, JavaScript Charting. DS.js, and Geomapping with Leaflet.js; Business Intelligence Software; Tableau: Advanced Topics; Big Data Analytics with Hadoop and Machine Learning.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently I live in Chesterfield, Virginia, but I am willing to relocate. Organization, self motivation, and the ability to adapt quickly to my environment are part of my core abilities.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My previous work experience includes working at the WestRock Corporation in the engineering department managing AutoDesk, AutoCAD, and AutoDesk Vault. I also worked at VCU Health Systems for two summers in patient accounting and preoperative surgical services departments.</p>
        <br>
        <p>My long-term goal is to find a data analytics position where I can use the skills I have learned. I am interested in any open positions where I could use my work and educational experience.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center">Thank you for your consideration.</p>
        <br>
        <p style="text-align: center">Sincerely,</p>
