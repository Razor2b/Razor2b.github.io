        <h2>Protfolio</h2>
       <p>This website I have coded completely by using HTML and CSS. I do also have a GitHub Repository that has all the work I did for the Bootcamp I took at University of Richmond. I have opened it to the public for you to take a look around to see what I have learned. When you look first open the website you will see # folders. Each one of these folders are labled with the what the topic was for this assignment. I included the intructions for the assignment and the included data for the assignent. I have put my answers in a folder that is labled "My Answer". </p>
